                <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
                <p>
                  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you
                  and Company regarding the use of the Company Services. The
                  failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or
                  provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of
                  such right or provision. The section titles in this Agreement
                  are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual
                  effect. This Agreement operates to the fullest extent
                  permissible by law. This Agreement and your account may not be
                  assigned by you without our express written consent. Company
                  may assign any or all of its rights and obligations to others
                  at any time. Company shall not be responsible or liable for
                  any loss, damage, delay or failure to act caused by any cause
                  beyond Company&#39;s reasonable control. If any provision or
                  part of a provision of this Agreement is unlawful, void or
                  unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is
                  deemed severable from this Agreement and does not affect the
                  validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There
                  is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
                  relationship created between you and Company as a result of
                  this Agreement or use of the Sites and Company Services. Upon
                  Company’s request, you will furnish Company any documentation,
                  substantiation or releases necessary to verify your compliance
                  with this Agreement. You agree that this Agreement will not be
                  construed against Company by virtue of having drafted them.
                  You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on
                  the electronic form of this Agreement and the lack of signing
                  by the parties hereto to execute this Agreement.
