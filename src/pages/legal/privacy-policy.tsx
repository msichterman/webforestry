                  personal information also includes various data that we
                  collect automatically. This may be the user’s Internet

                  improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease

                  users should inform themselves of the privacy policies and
                  practices (if any) of the third party responsible for those
                  Sites or applications, and should take those steps necessary
                  to, in those users’ discretion, protect their privacy.{" "}

                  We may provide you the option to connect your account on the

                  purpose of logging in, uploading personal information or
                  enabling certain features on the Sites. When logging in using
                  your social network credentials, we may collect the personal
                  information you have made publicly available on the social
                  networking site, such as your name, profile picture, cover
                  photo, username, gender, friends network, age range, locale,
                  friend list and any other personal information you have made

                  your network and your friends, including common friends. By
                  connecting your account on the Sites to your account on any

                  without first disclosing that to you. Each social network may
                  further allow you to set privacy controls around your personal
                  information on their system, and our collection of personal
                  information will always follow such controls and permissions.
                  This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement
                  by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore
                  the available features and shared personal information are
                  subject to change. Please visit our Privacy Notice for any

                  We may use hyperlinks on the Sites which will redirect you to
                  a social network if you click on the respective link. However,
                  when you click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook’s
                  &quot;Like&quot; button or Twitter’s “tweet” button that
                  particular social network’s plugin will be activated and your
                  browser will directly connect to that provider’s servers. If
                  you do not use these buttons none of your data will be sent to
                  the respective social network’s plugin providers. To
                  illustrate this further, imagine the scenario where you click
